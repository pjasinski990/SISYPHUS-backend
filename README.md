# SISYPHUS
SISYPHUS (Severely Impractical Scheduler You Predictably Hate but Ultimately Survive)
is my attempt at a custom task scheduler and day planner.

## Running the backend (this repo)

### Prerequisites

- make, docker, and docker-compose installed on your system

### Installation and running

1. Clone this repository:
   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:pjasinski990/SISYPHUS-backend.git
   cd SISYPHUS-backend
   ```
   
2. Run with the makefile command:
   ```shell
   make dev
   ```

3. Start the frontend. Follow the instructions in the [frontend repository](https://github.com/pjasinski990/SISYPHUS-frontend).

4. Once both frontend and backend are running, open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
